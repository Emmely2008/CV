## About me
My name is Emmely Lundberg. I'm currently studying a Top-Up programme at Copenhagen Business Academy.
The programme will results in a Bachelors Degree in Software Development in January 2019.
The final semester in autumn 2018 consists of internship and writing thesis. I'm open to internship placement.

As a person I see myself as very open, positive and flexible.
I have more than four years of working experience within the IT-field as a programmer in Sweden.
My current ambition is to work in Copenhagen either starting with a student job around two days per week or doing internship (September, October and November 2018).


## Language
My mother thong is Swedish but I have both studied and work using English.
Even though I don't speak Danish fluently I understand the language very well and have taken an evening course in the Danish language for Scandinavians.
